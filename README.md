# directorySearch
A python script that locates files or folders on the system, starting from the top of the directory tree. 

This script employs a tkinter GUI for input from the user, and the os library to navigate the file system. 

This is v1, and I'm currently working on fixing a bug and expanding the functionality of the program to allow for searching via md5 hash for a file,
as well as doing a preliminary check for whether the file or folder actually exists before searching the entire file system for it.
